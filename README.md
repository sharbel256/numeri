# Numeri
A risk trading platform currently supporting crypto only because it's the only market open 24/7. It's a full C++ project to extract the best performance possible. It gives the user the ability to BYOA (Bring Your Own Algorithm) and trade with it. It's currently in development and not ready for production use.

REST is implemented but I'm currently working on FIX API for a paved road approach to HFT.
